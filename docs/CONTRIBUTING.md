## Task Runner

All development commands use [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) with Bun as the runtime.

| Command | Alias | Description |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `task install` | `i` | Install all tools and dependencies |
| `task lint` | `l` | Run Biome linting |
| `task format` | `fmt` | Format code with Biome |
| `task typecheck` | `tc` | TypeScript type checking |
| `task test` | `t` | Run unit tests with Bun |
| `task test:coverage` | `cov` | Tests with coverage report |
| `task quality` | `q` | Run lint + typecheck + test |
| `task build` | `b` | Build CLI bundle |

Additional commands are available via `@northbridge-security/ai-toolkit`:

| Namespace | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `task git:<command>` | Git operations |
| `task json:<command>` | JSON validation |
| `task yaml:<command>` | YAML validation |
| `task markdown:<command>` | Markdown validation |
| `task security:<command>` | Security tools (Semgrep) |

## Development Workflow

This project uses Test-Driven Development (TDD). Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **Red** — Write a failing test that describes the expected behaviour
2. **Green** — Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor** — Improve the code while keeping tests green

Run the quality gate before committing:

```bash
task quality    # Runs lint + typecheck + test
```

Pre-commit hooks run `lint` and `typecheck` automatically via Husky. If either check fails, the commit is rejected.

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feat/your-feature
    ```

2. Make your changes following the [code style](#code-style) and [testing requirements](#testing-requirements).

3. Run the quality gate:

    ```bash
    task quality
    ```

4. Push and open a PR against `main`.

5. Fill in the PR template: summary, changes, test plan, related issues.

6. All CI checks must pass before merge:

    | Check | Purpose |
    | ----- | ------- |
    | lint | Biome linting |
    | typecheck | TypeScript type checking |
    | test | Unit tests with coverage |
    | security | Semgrep scan |

7. PRs are reviewed by CodeRabbit (automated) and a maintainer.

## Code Style

[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) handles formatting and linting. Configuration is in `biome.json`.

- Double quotes, semicolons, ES5 trailing commas
- 100 character line width, 2-space indentation
- Imports organized automatically
- No `console.log` in production code (enforced by Semgrep)

Format and lint:

```bash
task format     # Auto-format
task lint       # Check linting
```

## Testing Requirements

- Business logic requires 80%+ line coverage
- Validation code requires 100% coverage
- System files (`*.system.ts`) and CLI commands (`src/cli/**`) are excluded from coverage
- All tests use mocks for external dependencies (renderer, filesystem)
- No network or subprocess calls in unit tests

Tests use shared mock implementations:

- `tests/mocks/mock-renderer.ts` — returns fixed SVG strings, tracks calls
- `tests/mocks/mock-fs.ts` — operates on in-memory file maps

Run tests:

```bash
task test              # Run unit tests
task test:coverage     # Tests with coverage report
bun test tests/unit/services/extract.test.ts   # Single file
```

## Commit Messages

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated versioning via release-please.

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

| Type | Purpose | Changelog |
| ---- | ------- | --------- |
| `feat` | New feature | Visible |
| `fix` | Bug fix | Visible |
| `perf` | Performance improvement | Visible |
| `docs` | Documentation change | Visible |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature | Hidden |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests | Hidden |
| `chore` | Maintenance (dependencies, CI config) | Hidden |
| `ci` | CI/CD pipeline changes | Hidden |

Examples:

```
feat(render): add mtime-based staleness check
fix(extract): handle nested fenced blocks in markdown
docs: add architecture diagrams to ARCHITECTURE.md
```

## CI Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflows run on PRs to `main`:

| Workflow | File | Trigger | Purpose |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ------- |
| CI | `ci.yml` | PR to `main`, push to `main` | Lint, typecheck, test, security scan |
| Release | `release.yml` | Push to `main` | Create release PR via release-please |
| Auto-release | `auto-release.yml` | Release workflow completes | Auto-merge release PRs |
| CD | `cd.yml` | GitHub Release created | Build and publish to npm + GitHub Packages |
| Claude | `claude.yml` | `@claude` mention | Interactive Claude Code agent |
| Code Review | `claude-code-review.yml` | PR open/sync | Automated code review |

The CI workflow runs these jobs in parallel:

| Job | Command | Purpose |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| lint | `biome check src/ tests/` | Code style and lint rules |
| typecheck | `tsc --noEmit` | TypeScript type checking |
| test | `bun test tests/unit/ --coverage` | Unit tests with coverage |
| security | Semgrep scan | `p/security-audit`, `p/secrets`, `p/typescript` |
| quality-gate | (depends on all above) | All checks must pass for merge |

Every PR must pass all CI jobs before merging. The `quality-gate` job enforces this as a required status check on `main`. Locally, run `task quality` to check all gates before pushing.

## Release Process

Releases are automated using [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please):

1. Merge PRs with conventional commit messages to `main`.
2. Release-please creates a release PR that bumps the version and updates `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
3. The auto-release workflow merges the release PR after CI passes.
4. A GitHub Release is created, triggering the CD pipeline.
5. CD builds the CLI bundle and publishes to both registries:

    | Registry | URL |
    | -------- | --- |
    | npm | `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lekman/mmd` |
    | GitHub Packages | `https://npm.pkg.github.com/@lekman/mmd` |

## Code Review Tools

| Tool | Trigger | Configuration |
| ---- | ------- | ------------- |
| CodeRabbit | Automatic on PR | `.coderabbit.yml` — Biome, Semgrep, Gitleaks, Markdownlint |
| Claude Code Review | Automatic on PR | `claude-code-review.yml` — skips `release-please--*` branches |
| Claude Code Agent | `@claude` mention | `claude.yml` — interactive issue/PR agent |
| Semgrep | CI pipeline | `.semgrep.yml` — custom rules + cloud rulesets |

## Dependency Updates

[Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) is configured in `.github/dependabot.yml`:

| Ecosystem | Schedule | Max PRs | Grouping |
| --------- | -------- | ------- | -------- |
| npm | Weekly | 10 | Dev dependencies grouped by minor/patch |
| GitHub Actions | Weekly | 5 | None |
